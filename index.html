                <h2>Why Is Scripture Described as "Inspired by God"? <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span></h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>To say the Bible is "inspired by God" does not mean God sat down and wrote it the way a human author writes a book, nor does it mean God dictated every word while human writers simply transcribed it like secretaries. The word "inspired" comes from the Latin <em>inspirare</em> — to breathe into. The classic expression of this idea comes from the Second Letter to Timothy (2 Timothy 3:16): <em>"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness."</em></p>

                    <p>The image is almost physical: God breathing His life into the words, the way Genesis describes God breathing life into Adam (Genesis 2:7). The Second Letter of Peter adds: <em>"No prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit"</em> (2 Peter 1:20–21).</p>

                    <h3>What Inspiration Actually Means</h3>
                    <p>The Catholic understanding — refined over centuries of theological reflection — is that inspiration is a cooperative partnership between God and the human author. God is the <em>primary</em> author of Scripture, meaning He is ultimately responsible for what is communicated and guarantees its truth for our salvation. But the human writers — Moses, David, Isaiah, Luke, Paul — are <em>genuine secondary authors</em>, not passive robots. They brought their own personalities, literary styles, historical knowledge, cultural assumptions, and limitations to the text. God worked <em>through</em> their humanity, not around it.</p>

                    <p>This is why the Gospel of Matthew reads differently from the Gospel of John. It is why Paul's letters feel urgent and argumentative while the Book of Psalms feels poetic and emotional. God did not erase the humanity of the authors — He used it.</p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Dei Verbum Doctrine</strong>
                        <p>The Catholic Church defines this formally in the document <em>Dei Verbum</em> (Divine Revelation) from the Second Vatican Council: <em>"In composing the sacred books, God chose men and while employed by Him they made use of their powers and abilities, so that with Him acting in them and through them, they, as true authors, consigned to writing everything and only those things which He wanted."</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>What Inspiration Does and Does Not Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>Here is where many people get confused. Saying the Bible is inspired does not mean every statement in it is scientifically precise or historically accurate by modern standards. The Church has always taught that inspiration guarantees <em>salvific truth</em> — the truths God intends to communicate about Himself, humanity, sin, salvation, and how to live. It does not turn the Bible into a geology textbook or a biography with footnotes.</p>

                    <p>When Genesis says God created the world in six days, the Church does not require Catholics to believe the earth is literally 6,000 years old. The inspired author was communicating profound theological truths — God is creator, creation is good, humanity has a special dignity — using the literary forms available in ancient Hebrew culture. The <em>Dei Verbum</em> document states precisely that Scripture teaches <em>"without error that truth which God wanted put into the sacred writings for the sake of our salvation."</em> The key phrase is "for the sake of our salvation" — that is the scope of inerrancy.</p>

            <!-- Section 2 -->
            <section class="section" id="section2">
                <h2>Why Does the Catholic Bible Contain Exactly 73 Books? <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span></h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>This question goes to the heart of one of the most significant — and often misunderstood — differences between Catholic and Protestant Christianity. A standard Protestant Bible contains 66 books. The Catholic Bible contains 73. The seven additional books in the Catholic Old Testament are called the <em>Deuterocanonical</em> books (from the Greek for "second canon"), and they are: Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (also called the Wisdom of Solomon), Sirach (also called Ecclesiasticus), and Baruch, along with some additional sections of Daniel and Esther. Protestants often call these books "the Apocrypha."</p>

                    <h3>The Two Jewish Canons</h3>
                    <p>The story begins not with Christianity but with Judaism in the centuries just before Christ. By that time, Jewish communities were scattered across the Mediterranean world, and many no longer spoke Hebrew fluently. In Alexandria, Egypt — the greatest cultural center of the ancient world — Jewish scholars produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures known as the <em>Septuagint</em> (meaning "seventy," from the legendary story of seventy translators). This translation, completed roughly between 200 and 100 BC, included the Deuterocanonical books.</p>

                    <p>The Septuagint became the Bible of Greek-speaking Jews and, crucially, it became the Bible used by the early Christian Church. When Paul quotes the Old Testament in his letters, he is almost always quoting the Septuagint. When Matthew's Gospel cites Isaiah's prophecy about a virgin conceiving (Matthew 1:23), he draws on the Septuagint's Greek word <em>parthenos</em> (virgin) rather than the Hebrew <em>almah</em> (young woman). The Septuagint's 46-book Old Testament was the Bible of the apostolic Church.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, Jewish authorities in Palestine were using a slightly different, shorter collection — the Hebrew scriptures as preserved in the Hebrew language, which did not include the Deuterocanonical books (most of which were composed in Greek or survive only in Greek). After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, Jewish scholars gathering at Jamnia around 90 AD consolidated around this shorter Hebrew canon.</p>

                    <h3>The Early Church's Inheritance</h3>
                    <p>The first Christians did not sit down and choose a Bible from scratch. They inherited the Septuagint as their Old Testament and gradually accumulated the writings of the apostles and their associates as their New Testament. Church Fathers writing in the 2nd and 3rd centuries — Clement of Rome, Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian — quoted from the Deuterocanonical books as authoritative Scripture. Origen specifically cited Tobit, Judith, Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach alongside the undisputed books of the Hebrew Bible.</p>

                    <p>St. Augustine, the most influential theologian in Western Christianity's history, explicitly included all 73 books in his understanding of the biblical canon. The Council of Hippo in 393 AD and the Council of Carthage in 397 AD — provincial synods at which Augustine was present and influential — both listed all 73 books as canonical, and their decisions were confirmed by Pope Innocent I in 405 AD.</p>

                    <h3>The Reformation and the Protestant Reduction to 66</h3>
                    <p>When Martin Luther launched the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, he challenged several Catholic doctrines and looked for scriptural support to do so. The Catholic teaching on purgatory drew support partly from 2 Maccabees 12:46, where prayer for the dead is described. Luther, rejecting purgatory, turned to the shorter Hebrew canon (the one without the Deuterocanonical books) and reclassified those seven books as non-canonical, reducing the Old Testament from 46 to 39 books. He was returning, he argued, to the Hebrew sources.</p>

                    <p>The Catholic Church responded at the Council of Trent in 1546, formally defining the 73-book canon as the authoritative Catholic Bible. This was not a new decision inventing a canon — it was a solemn reaffirmation of what had been the Church's consistent practice since the 4th century, against Luther's reduction. The Eastern Orthodox Church, independently, has also retained the Deuterocanonical books (and in fact includes a few additional ones beyond what Catholics accept).</p>

                    <h3>So Why Exactly 73?</h3>
                    <p>These 73 books — and not more, and not fewer — are the books the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit and drawing on centuries of liturgical use, apostolic testimony, and doctrinal testing, recognized as genuinely inspired. They are not the books the Church <em>made</em> sacred — they are the books the Church <em>recognized</em> as having a divine quality already present in them. The number is not arbitrary; it reflects a historical process of discernment that unfolded over the first four centuries of Christianity.</p>

                <h2>Why Are the Gospel of Thomas and Other Apocryphal Gospels Not Considered Inspired? <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span></h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>In 1945, Egyptian farmers near the town of Nag Hammadi accidentally discovered a buried jar containing 52 ancient texts written on papyrus, in a script called Coptic. Among them was a complete copy of the Gospel of Thomas — a collection of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus. This discovery caused enormous excitement in academic circles and, eventually, in popular culture (Dan Brown's <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> played heavily on the idea of "hidden gospels"). The natural question people ask is: why did the Church suppress these texts?</p>

                    <p>The honest answer is: the Church did not suppress them. They were largely unknown because they had not been used. And when they were known, the reason they were excluded was not political conspiracy but a set of principled theological and historical criteria that the Church applied consistently.</p>

                    <p>The word "apocryphal" comes from the Greek for "hidden" — texts that were kept aside, not in public circulation. Beyond the Gospel of Thomas, the apocryphal gospels include the Gospel of Philip, the Gospel of Judas, the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas (stories about Jesus as a child), the Proto-Gospel of James, and dozens more. Most of these date from the 2nd century AD or later — well after the apostolic period.</p>

                    <h3>Why They Failed the Test of Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>Several clear reasons explain why these texts did not meet the Church's criteria:</p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>They Were Too Late</strong>
                        <p>The four canonical Gospels — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John — were composed between roughly 65 AD and 100 AD, within living memory of people who had known Jesus and the original apostles. The Gospel of Thomas, in its written form, dates to around 140–200 AD. The Gospel of Philip is from the late 2nd to early 3rd century. The Gospel of Judas is now dated to around 280 AD — over two centuries after Jesus. The further a text is from the apostolic eyewitnesses, the less reliable it is as testimony. The early Church understood this intuitively and consistently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>They Were Not Apostolic</strong>
                        <p>The canonical books were either written by apostles (Matthew, John, Paul) or by close associates of apostles writing under apostolic supervision and authority (Mark writing under Peter's influence, Luke under Paul's). The apocryphal gospels claimed apostolic authorship they did not have — the Gospel of Thomas claims to be by Thomas, the Gospel of Philip by Philip — but scholars have found no credible evidence supporting these claims. Attributing a text to a famous apostle was, unfortunately, a common literary device in the ancient world.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Their Content Contradicted the Apostolic Message</strong>
                        <p>The Gospel of Thomas is deeply Gnostic in orientation. Gnosticism was an ancient worldview that saw the physical world as evil, created by an inferior or malevolent god, and taught that salvation came through secret spiritual knowledge (<em>gnosis</em>) available only to an enlightened elite. The final saying of the Gospel of Thomas has Jesus telling Peter that Mary Magdalene must "make herself male" to enter the Kingdom — deeply alien to the Christian vision of human dignity. Much of the Gospel of Thomas presents a radically different Jesus from the one in the canonical Gospels — one who never speaks of love of neighbor, never teaches about forgiveness, never performs miracles of compassion. This Jesus hoards secret wisdom rather than sharing it openly.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The canonical Gospels, by contrast, tell a remarkably consistent story across four independent accounts: a Jewish Jesus who announces the Kingdom of God, heals the sick, forgives sinners, is crucified, and rises from the dead. The core message is consistent even across their stylistic and theological differences. The apocryphal gospels, taken together, present wildly divergent pictures that cannot be harmonized with the apostolic tradition.</p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>They Were Not Used by the Universal Church</strong>
                        <p>By the time the Church was formally discerning the canon, the four Gospels were already in universal liturgical use across Christian communities from Rome to Antioch to Alexandria. The apocryphal gospels were local and sectarian — used by specific Gnostic communities but not by the mainstream Church. The universality of liturgical use was itself a theological sign: the Spirit speaking consistently to the whole Body of Christ, not just to particular factions.</p>

                <h2>What Do Church Councils and Canons State About Inspiration and Authority? <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span></h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The formal definition of the canon emerged gradually through a series of Church declarations. It is worth walking through the most important ones:</p>

                    <h3>The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170–180 AD)</h3>
                    <p>This is the earliest known list of New Testament books, named after the Italian scholar Muratori who discovered it. It is fragmentary — the beginning is missing — but it lists most of the canonical New Testament books and explicitly excludes certain texts, calling the Shepherd of Hermas "recent" and therefore not prophetic, and rejecting texts associated with Marcion and the Gnostics. It shows that by the late 2nd century, the core of the New Testament was already clearly defined in Rome.</p>

                    <h3>Councils of Hippo and Carthage (393 and 397 AD)</h3>
                    <p>These North African councils, held under St. Augustine's significant influence, produced the first formal canonical lists that match exactly the 73-book Catholic Bible as defined later at Trent. Their decisions were submitted to Rome and confirmed by Pope Innocent I. These councils did not create the canon — they recognized and formally codified what was already the consistent practice of the major churches.</p>

                    <h3>Pope Damasus I (382 AD)</h3>
                    <p>Pope Damasus, who commissioned St. Jerome to produce the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, issued a formal canonical list that includes all 73 books. This is one of the earliest papal statements on the canon and carries considerable weight in Catholic tradition.</p>

                    <h3>The Council of Florence (1442 AD)</h3>
                    <p>This council, attempting reunion with the Eastern churches, produced the <em>Decree for the Jacobites</em>, which contained an explicit canonical list of all 73 books, affirming that all were inspired and authoritative.</p>

                    <h3>The Council of Trent (1546 AD)</h3>
                    <p>This is the most decisive conciliar statement on the canon in Catholic history. In response to the Protestant Reformation's challenge, Trent formally and solemnly defined the 73-book canon as the authoritative Catholic Bible. The council stated that anyone who rejected any of these books, "in whole or in part," as sacred and canonical was to be considered outside the Catholic Church. Trent also affirmed that Scripture and Tradition together form the single sacred deposit of God's word — rejecting Luther's principle of <em>sola scriptura</em> (Scripture alone).</p>

                    <h3>The First Vatican Council (1870 AD)</h3>
                    <p>Vatican I reaffirmed Trent's canonical list and added important theological precision about inspiration itself: the books are canonical not because human authority approved them, but because "having been written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their author." This is the key theological distinction: the Church did not <em>make</em> these books inspired by including them in the canon. It <em>recognized</em> an inspiration already present in them.</p>

                    <h3>The Second Vatican Council — Dei Verbum (1965 AD)</h3>
                    <p>As discussed earlier, <em>Dei Verbum</em> provided the most nuanced and complete modern statement of Catholic teaching on Scripture. It described the relationship between Scripture and Tradition as forming "one sacred deposit" of God's word, defined the nature of inspiration as a genuine human-divine cooperation, and affirmed that Scripture teaches "without error" the truths necessary for salvation. It also emphasized that the Magisterium (the Church's teaching authority) is not above the Word of God but serves it.</p>

                <h2>Why Did the Church Establish Criteria for Selecting Which Books Belong in the Bible? <span class="toggle-icon">▼</span></h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>This question gets to a fascinating and often overlooked historical reality: the Bible as a single bound collection did not fall from the sky. It was assembled by human beings, guided by the Holy Spirit, over several centuries. And the need to make that assembly explicit arose from very specific historical pressures.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem That Made a Canon Necessary</h3>
                    <p>In the first century, Christian communities passed around letters, gospels, and accounts of apostolic teaching. Nobody had a fixed list of which texts were authoritative. Most communities had access to only some of these writings. This was manageable as long as the faith was young and geographically concentrated. But as Christianity spread rapidly across the Roman Empire and beyond, and as time passed and memories of the original apostles faded, two serious problems emerged:</p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Problem One: False Texts</strong>
                        <p>As noted, the 2nd century produced a flood of texts claiming apostolic authorship — gospels attributed to Thomas, Philip, Mary, and others; "acts" of apostles loaded with legendary material; "apocalypses" attributed to Peter and Paul. Communities needed to be able to distinguish genuine apostolic teaching from later inventions, some of which were promoting profoundly different versions of Christianity (especially Gnosticism).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Problem Two: Marcion's Mutilated Bible</strong>
                        <p>Around 140 AD, a wealthy shipbuilder named Marcion arrived in Rome teaching that the God of the Old Testament — the Creator, the lawgiver, the God of wrath — was a completely different being from the God of Jesus. He produced his own Bible: only a heavily edited version of Luke's Gospel, and ten of Paul's letters, with all positive references to Judaism removed. This was not a fringe movement — Marcionite churches spread widely and survived for centuries. The mainstream Church had to make explicit what it had always implicitly understood: the Hebrew Scriptures are part of the Christian Bible, Jesus is the fulfillment of Judaism's God, and the two Testaments cannot be separated.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Problem Three: Persecution</strong>
                        <p>The Roman Empire periodically persecuted Christians and sometimes demanded that Christians hand over their sacred texts for destruction. A Christian being arrested needed to know which books were worth dying to protect, and which could be surrendered without betraying the faith. This was an intensely practical pressure to define which texts were truly sacred.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Criteria the Church Applied</h3>
                    <p>When early Christians assessed which books were genuinely inspired, they asked a consistent set of questions:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Apostolicity:</strong> Was this text written by an apostle, or by someone with direct access to apostolic teaching? The apostles were the eyewitnesses whom Jesus himself had commissioned. A text cut off from apostolic testimony had no claim to authority.</li>
                        <li><strong>Antiquity:</strong> Was this text old enough to have plausibly come from the apostolic period? Texts appearing centuries later with convenient new revelations were immediately suspect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Orthodoxy:</strong> Did this text teach consistently with what the Church had always believed? The canon of Scripture and the "rule of faith" (the basic summary of Christian belief that became the Creed) mutually reinforced each other. A text that contradicted the Incarnation, the Resurrection, or the goodness of creation was not inspired — regardless of what apostle's name it carried.</li>
                        <li><strong>Universal Reception:</strong> Was this text recognized as authoritative across the major Christian communities — Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem? A text valued only by a local sect was unlikely to reflect the universal witness of the Spirit to the whole Church.</li>
                        <li><strong>Liturgical Use:</strong> Was this text already being read in the Church's worship? The liturgy was the primary context in which the Bible lived. Books that had been consistently read in the Eucharistic assembly across generations carried a weight that privately circulated texts did not.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Canon Was Recognized, Not Invented</h3>
                    <p>This point deserves emphasis because it is often misunderstood. When people discover that the canon was formally defined at councils in the 4th and 5th centuries, they sometimes conclude: "The Church invented the Bible. Before those councils, anything could have been in there." This misreads the history.</p>

                    <p>By the time the councils formally listed the canonical books, those books had already been in universal use for decades or centuries. The councils did not create the canon — they recognized and confirmed what the practice of the Church had already established. Think of it like a country formally codifying its constitution: the values and principles being enshrined were not invented on the day of codification. They had been lived for generations. The codification made explicit and permanent what was already real.</p>

                    <p>St. Augustine articulated this principle clearly: <em>"I would not believe in the Gospel, had not the authority of the Catholic Church already moved me."</em> This sounds startling until you understand what he meant — not that the Church's authority is greater than the Gospel, but that it is through the Church's living testimony and recognition that we know which books constitute the Gospel in the first place. Scripture and the Church are mutually interdependent: the Church produced the New Testament, and the New Testament describes and authorizes the Church. Neither is intelligible without the other.</p>

                    <h3>Why This Matters Today</h3>
                    <p>Understanding why the canon is what it is matters for a simple reason: the Bible is not a self-interpreting, self-authenticating collection of books that arrived in a single package from heaven. It is the Church's book — produced within the community of faith, shaped by the community of faith, and intended to be read within the community of faith. This is why the Catholic Church insists that Scripture cannot be properly understood apart from Tradition and the Magisterium. The same Spirit who inspired the authors of Scripture guided the community in recognizing which writings bore that inspiration — and continues to guide the Church in interpreting them faithfully across time.</p>

                    <p>The apocryphal gospels were not suppressed out of political fear. The Deuterocanonical books were not added as Catholic propaganda. The 73-book canon reflects centuries of Spirit-guided discernment, apostolic testimony, liturgical practice, and theological testing — a process far more careful, complex, and honest than either conspiracy theorists or religious skeptics typically acknowledge.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The Bible is called "inspired by God" because, in the Catholic understanding, God and the human authors worked together to produce a text that genuinely and reliably communicates the truth necessary for human salvation — while fully preserving the humanity of the authors. The 73-book Catholic canon reflects the consistent practice of the early Church, which inherited the Septuagint's broader Old Testament, recognized the New Testament writings on apostolic authority, and formally defined the complete list at councils whose decisions were confirmed by papal authority. Texts like the Gospel of Thomas were excluded because they were too late, lacked genuine apostolic origin, contradicted the consistent apostolic message, and were never universally received by the Church. The criteria the Church applied — apostolicity, antiquity, orthodoxy, universal reception, and liturgical use — were principled, consistent, and historically defensible. And the whole process reflects the Catholic conviction that Scripture and Church are inseparable: the same Spirit who breathed life into the sacred texts also guided the community of faith in recognizing them.</p>
